Hello Michael Champagne,

A couple of months ago I started to develop a GPS lap timer using the Arduino platform and have made some good progress... 

Then tonight I found your library that appears to be really well thought out so I thought I'd have a go at using it for the basis of 
my timer, however I am running into some issues when trying to compile and I can't seem to make any head way. I understand that
you might not have time to give any help... but on the off chance you do, my email is captainbenno73@gmail.com

cheers,
BEN

ps: I can't find any other way of contacting you so hopefully you see this addition to the project.
